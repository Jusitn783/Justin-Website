        <h2>3D Printed RC Boat</h2>
        <p>This project was simply to see if a 3D printed RC boat could work and how good a 3D printed boat could float and move in the water. I 3D printed the body of the boat and am testing it on water to check its performance.</p>

        <p>This project was simply to see if a 3D printed RC boat could work and how good a 3D printed boat could float and move in the water. The boat is powered by a small motor, and I’m testing its performance on water to check its speed and handling.</p>

        <h2>Game Development: A Story of Loss</h2>
        <p>In my IT class, I’m working on a group project for a game where you play as a man whose wife was involved in a car crash. The main character struggles with schizophrenia and begins seeing things that aren't real. The game explores themes of grief, mental health, and coping with loss through an interactive story.</p>

        <p>The game is being developed using Unity, and I’m focusing on creating an immersive experience with complex narrative-driven gameplay. I’m experimenting with visual and audio cues to represent the character’s mental state and his journey through the trauma.</p>
