        <h2>Chromebook Repair Internship</h2>
        <p>
          I currently work as an intern repairing Chromebooks for my high school. In this role, I’m responsible for troubleshooting hardware and software issues, diagnosing problems, and finding solutions to ensure the devices are working properly. It’s a hands-on position that allows me to build my technical skills while helping students and staff stay connected and productive. This internship has taught me a lot about problem-solving, attention to detail, and how to work under pressure, as I often have to fix devices quickly to minimize downtime. It’s been a rewarding experience that’s helped me grow both professionally and personally.

        <h2>Dayton Cyber Challenge - First Place</h2>
        <p>
          My school recently participated in the Dayton Cyber Challenge, hosted by Reynolds and Reynolds, and we proudly secured first place! It was an amazing experience, as we competed against other high schools in various cybersecurity challenges. Throughout the competition, our team demonstrated our technical knowledge, problem-solving skills, and ability to work together under pressure. Winning first place was a testament to our hard work and dedication, and it was a huge accomplishment for our school.
