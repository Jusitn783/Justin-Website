            <h1>My Coding Projects</h1>
            <p>Here’s a look at how I approach creating my game and website, including the steps I take, challenges I face, and how I use platforms like <code>code.org</code> to learn and build.</p>

            <h2>Game Development</h2>
            <p>
                In my current game project, the main character is struggling with schizophrenia and processing grief after a tragic event. Here’s a breakdown of how I approach creating this game:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Concept & Storyline:</strong> I start with a clear idea of what the story is about and how it will play out. The story for this game is driven by emotions and mental health struggles, which will be reflected in the gameplay.</li>
                <li><strong>Game Design:</strong> I then create a rough design of how the game will look, what mechanics will be included, and how the user will interact with it.</li>
                <li><strong>Programming:</strong> I use JavaScript for the game logic, focusing on managing game states (e.g., intro, main game, end). The character's behavior, including interactions with the environment, is handled through conditionals and event listeners.</li>
                <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> I constantly test the game to find and fix issues. This could involve fixing problems with the character’s movement or ensuring the UI is functioning correctly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Code Example from the Game</h3>
            <p>Here's a snippet from my current game project:</p>
            <pre><code>
                // Character movement code
                function moveCharacter() {
                    if (keyPressed == 'left') {
                        character.x -= speed;
                    } else if (keyPressed == 'right') {
                        character.x += speed;
                    }
                    if (keyPressed == 'up') {
                        character.y -= speed;
                    } else if (keyPressed == 'down') {
                        character.y += speed;
                    }
                }
            </code></pre>
        </section>

        <section class="website-development">
            <h2>Website Development</h2>
            <p>
                For my personal website, I focus on making sure the design is clean, easy to navigate, and showcases my work. Here’s how I go about it:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Layout & Structure:</strong> I use HTML to structure the content, ensuring it’s easy to read and responsive. I also make use of CSS to create a layout that adjusts based on the screen size.</li>
                <li><strong>Design Choices:</strong> I choose a minimalistic style with dark colors to make the content stand out and reduce distractions for the user.</li>
                <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> I use JavaScript to add interactivity to the website, like animations and transitions when the user clicks or scrolls.</li>
                <li><strong>Testing & Optimization:</strong> I frequently test my site on different devices to make sure it functions as expected and adjust the code where necessary.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Code Example from the Website</h3>
            <p>Here's a snippet from my website's code:</p>
            <pre><code>
                // Example of a smooth scroll effect for navigation
                document.querySelector('.smooth-scroll').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
                    event.preventDefault();
                    document.querySelector(event.target.hash).scrollIntoView({
                        behavior: 'smooth'
                    });
                });
            </code></pre>
        </section>

        <section class="code-org">
            <h2>Using Code.org</h2>
            <p>
                I use <a href="https://code.org" target="_blank">code.org</a> as a learning platform to improve my coding skills, especially in areas like game development and logic-based problem solving. The lessons on code.org are useful because they break down complex concepts into manageable pieces.
            </p>
            <p>Here’s how I use code.org to enhance my projects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Learning Fundamentals:</strong> I take courses on coding basics and game development to build a strong foundation in programming concepts.</li>
                <li><strong>Project Building:</strong> I use code.org’s sandbox environment to build small projects before applying the skills to my larger games or websites.</li>
                <li><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> I practice solving coding challenges on code.org to improve my ability to troubleshoot and fix issues in my projects.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Code.org Project Example</h3>
            <p>Here’s a snippet from a simple game I created on code.org:</p>
            <pre><code>
                // Simple game logic
                function startGame() {
                    var score = 0;
                    while (score < 10) {
                        // Game loop
                        score += 1;
                    }
                    alert('You win!');
                }
            </code></pre>
