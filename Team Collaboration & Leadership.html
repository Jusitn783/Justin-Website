            <h1>Teamwork and Collaboration</h1>
            <p>Here’s a look at how I work with teams in different aspects of my life, from cross country and track to building a game with a group of people.</p>

            <h2>Cross Country & Track Collaboration</h2>
            <p>
                Running in both cross-country and track has taught me the importance of collaboration, especially when working as a team. The focus isn't just on individual performance, but also on supporting one another to achieve team goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                During cross-country, the goal is to work together, pacing each other during long runs, pushing teammates to do their best, and celebrating collective achievements. The bond formed in these moments helps create a more successful team dynamic.
            </p>
            <p>
                In track, it's similar—though more specialized. Everyone works on their own events, but there's always mutual support. When you're running the same race as a teammate or cheering someone on before their race, the spirit of teamwork shines through.

            </div>
            <p>In both sports, it’s not just about the competition. It’s about creating an environment where every teammate has the chance to improve and achieve their best.</p>

            <h2>Game Development Collaboration</h2>
            <p>
                Working on my game project with a group of people has also taught me valuable lessons about collaboration. In game development, it's essential that each person brings their skills and expertise to the table while communicating clearly.
            </p>
            <p>
                My role in the game project involves designing the game's logic and helping with the programming. However, it's a team effort with everyone contributing in different ways. Whether it's designing the storyline, creating the art, or refining the user experience, we all rely on one another's skills to bring the project to life.

            </div>
            <p>
                While coding the game, we use a variety of tools to keep everyone on the same page, such as group chats, shared code repositories, and project management platforms. It's a learning process, and each step brings us closer to making the game a reality.
