      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey, I’m Justin! I’ve always been into technology and love solving problems through IT. Whether it’s troubleshooting, coding, or figuring out how things work, I enjoy the challenge of breaking things down and finding solutions. Outside of tech, running has been a big part of my life. I’ve spent the past three years on my high school’s cross-country, indoor, and outdoor track teams, always working to get better. Running has taught me discipline, perseverance, and how to push myself, skills that also come in handy with IT. No matter what I’m doing, I’m always looking for ways to improve and take on new challenges.
