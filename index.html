      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Justin. I'm passionate about IT and love problem-solving through technology. Alongside my interest
        in tech, running has been a big part of my life. For the past three years, I've been dedicated to my high school’s
        cross-country, indoor, and outdoor track teams, pushing myself to improve with every season. Running has taught me
        discipline, perseverance, and the value of hard work — skills that I also bring into my interest in IT. Whether it’s
        coding, troubleshooting, or training for my next race, I’m always looking for ways to challenge myself and grow.
      </p>
